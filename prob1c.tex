% Problem 1c goes below

The table $Student$ has the following functional dependencies:

$SID \rightarrow Surname, PrefName, Email$
$Email \rightarrow Surname, PrefName, SID$

These should hold because both $SID$ and $Email$ is unique to each student.
\\\\
The table $NumGrade$ has the following functional dependency, which should hold because each letter grade has a specific grade point:

$Letter \rightarrow Number, GPA$
\\\\
The table $Course$ has the following functional dependencies:

$CID, Term \rightarrow Subject, CSRE, Section$

$Subject, CSRE \rightarrow Units$
\\\\
The table $Meetings$ has the following MVDs:

$SID, Term \twoheadrightarrow Instructor$

$SID, Term \twoheadrightarrow Type$

There aren't any functional dependencies that may hold, meaning each attribute is part of the key, because there are a lot of potential corner cases in the data where data can be missing and is forced to use replicated data surrounding entries.
\\\\
The table $Enrollment$ has the following functional dependencies:

$SID, CID, Term \rightarrow Grade, Units, Class, Seat, Status, Level$

$RN \rightarrow Term, CID, SID, Major$

$SID, CID, Term \twoheadrightarrow Major$

There is potential corruption of the database such that a student can end up with multiple majors in the same term. This is assuming that double majors are not implemented in this system. So, $RN$ will make up for this deficiency if needed.
